# Chip8 VM

I have started writing yet another Chip8 virtual machine, this time in Zig!

To be honest, although I am not completely sold on the syntax, I have really enjoyed the ease of writing 
and compiling the language. I have been able to include WASM as a target, and it has been a breeze to write 
an ABI that does exactly what I need without reaching for external libraries. 

With this in mind I think I will use Zig for all future emulator projects! But first to finish this one 
and onto the full suite Chip8 IDE that I have been wanting to create for a while now.
